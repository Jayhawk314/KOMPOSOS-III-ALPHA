### 1.2 Core Innovation
- **Paradigm shift**: Category theory replaces gradient descent
- **Explainable AI**: Every inference has traceable mathematical justification
- **Data efficiency**: Works with structure, not statistics (no massive training data)
- **Cross-domain discovery**: Functorial mappings enable analogical reasoning

### 1.3 Technology Stack
- Python 3.8+ core framework (4,600+ lines)
- SQLite persistence (3.8MB live database)

- FPGA roadmap (Xilinx PYNQ-Z2)

### 1.4 Key Features
1. **Knowledge Ingestion**: LLM-powered extraction from PDFs/academic sources
2. **Categorical Gap Detection**: Find missing morphisms (relationships)
3. **Hypothesis Generation**: Create new knowledge via categorical laws
4. **7-Test Verification Engine**: Composition, associativity, identity, probability coherence, vector consistency, sheaf coherence, universal properties
5. **Multi-Domain Runners**: Physics, biology, chemistry, economics, astronomy
6. **Sheaf Semantics**: Context-dependent meaning verification

### 1.5 Business Potential

---

# PART II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION STRATEGY

---

## 1. CURRENT LICENSING PROBLEM

**ALL projects currently have MIT License**, which:
- Allows unlimited commercial use
- Permits modification and redistribution
- Requires only minimal attribution
- Provides NO protection against competitors

**This effectively gives away your IP for free.**

---

## 2. RECOMMENDED LICENSE OPTIONS

### 2.1 Option A: Business Source License (BSL) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**What it is:** Source-available license that restricts production use, then converts to open source after a "change date."

**How it works:**
- Source code visible (good for trust/collaboration)
- Production use requires commercial license
- After 3-4 years, converts to Apache 2.0
- Customizable revenue thresholds

**Used by:** HashiCorp, Sentry, MariaDB, CockroachDB

**Best for:** KOMPOSOS-jf, KOMPOSOS-III, CatLift-fin

**Example clause:**
```
Additional Use Grant: You may use the Licensed Work for development,
testing, and non-production purposes. Production use requires a
commercial license from [Your Company].

Change Date: Four years from release date
Change License: Apache License 2.0
```

### 2.2 Option B: Server Side Public License (SSPL)

**What it is:** Strong copyleft license requiring anyone offering the software as a service to release ALL their source code.

**How it works:**
- Code can be used freely
- BUT offering it as a service requires releasing entire stack
- Effectively prevents cloud providers from monetizing

**Used by:** MongoDB, Elastic (historically), Graylog

**Best for:** CatLift-cpa (prevents audit firms from building SaaS without license)

**Downside:** Not OSI-approved, some organizations avoid SSPL software

### 2.3 Option C: Proprietary + Evaluation License

**What it is:** Fully proprietary with evaluation terms for private repos.

**How it works:**
- All rights reserved
- Evaluation license for private GitHub viewers
- Commercial license required for any use

**Best for:** Maximum protection, especially CatLift-cpa

**Example:**
```
Copyright (c) 2026 James. All Rights Reserved.

This software is proprietary and confidential. Viewing this code
does not grant any license to use, modify, or distribute.

For commercial licensing inquiries: [contact info]
```

### 2.4 Option D: Functional Source License (FSL)

**What it is:** Simpler BSL alternative from Sentry (2023).

**How it works:**
- Non-compete restriction for 2 years
- Converts to MIT/Apache after 2 years
- Clearer terms than BSL

**Best for:** Projects where you want eventual open source

### 2.5 License Recommendation Matrix

| Project | Recommended License | Rationale |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| KOMPOSOS-jf | BSL 1.1 | Balance visibility + protection |
| CatLift (base) | Apache 2.0 or BSL | Foundation layer, less critical |
| CatLift-fin | BSL 1.1 | Commercial financial application |
| CatLift-cpa | **Proprietary or SSPL** | Highest value, maximum protection |
| KOMPOSOS-III | BSL 1.1 | Research tool, balance needed |

---

## 3. ADDITIONAL IP PROTECTION MECHANISMS

### 3.1 Copyright (Automatic)
**Status:** You automatically own copyright to all source code.

**Action:** Add copyright notices to all files:
```
Copyright (c) 2024-2026 James. All Rights Reserved.
Licensed under [chosen license] - see LICENSE file.
```

### 3.2 Trade Secrets
**Protectable elements:**
- Categorical hypothesis verification algorithms
- Sheaf coherence checking methods
- Audit fraud detection strategies
- Game-theoretic optimization approaches

**Requirements for trade secret protection:**
- Must remain confidential
- Must have economic value from secrecy
- Must take reasonable steps to protect

**Conflict with GitHub:** Public repos destroy trade secret status. Even private repos with collaborators weaken protection.

**Recommendation:** Keep core algorithmic innovations in separate, non-shared components.

### 3.3 Patent Potential

**Patentability Analysis:**

| Element | Patentable? | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Category theory math | NO | Abstract mathematical method |
| Sheaf coherence for NLP | MAYBE | Application to technical problem |
| Categorical audit verification | LIKELY | Specific technical application |
| Ricci curvature for knowledge graphs | MAYBE | Novel technical application |
| FPGA categorical acceleration | LIKELY | Hardware implementation |

**2025 USPTO Guidance:** More favorable to AI/software patents. Claims involving steps that cannot practically be performed in the human mind may qualify.

**Potential Patent Applications:**
1. "Method for detecting control deficiencies in audit data using categorical analysis"
2. "System for scientific hypothesis verification using sheaf coherence checking"
3. "Hardware acceleration of categorical reasoning operations"

**Cost:** $15K-$30K per patent application (provisional + utility)

**Timeline:** 2-4 years for grant

### 3.4 Trademark
**Protectable marks:**
- KOMPOSOS™
- CatLift™
- "Categorical Operating System"

**Action:** File intent-to-use trademark applications ($250-$350 per class)

---

## 4. GITHUB STRATEGY

### 4.1 Private Repository Best Practices

**For Private Repos:**
1. Add LICENSE file with chosen license (NOT MIT)
2. Add CONFIDENTIALITY_NOTICE.md
3. Add copyright headers to all source files
