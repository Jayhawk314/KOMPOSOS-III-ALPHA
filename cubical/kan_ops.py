Kan Operations - The Computational Heart of Cubical Type Theory

Kan operations let us FILL GAPS in cubes:
- Given some faces of a cube, compute the missing face
- This is how we complete partial information

Key operations:
1. hcomp (homogeneous composition): compose paths
2. hfill (homogeneous filling): fill the interior of a cube
3. comp (path composition): p · q for p : a = b, q : b = c
4. inv (path inverse): p⁻¹ for p : a = b gives b = a

In KOMPOSOS-III, Kan operations enable:
- Automatic gap-filling in incomplete knowledge
- Path composition for chained reasoning
- Inverse paths for bidirectional inference

The "magic" of cubical type theory: these operations are COMPUTATIONAL.
They actually compute fillers, not just assert they exist.
